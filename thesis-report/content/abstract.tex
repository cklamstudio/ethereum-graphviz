Ethereum is one of the most popular decentralized platforms for executing computer programs, they often refer to smart contracts which provide extensive applications on top of transferring value in Ether. The records of Ethereum transactions have grown into large datasets since the launch of Ethereum in 2015, there are over 9 million transactions occurred by the end of 2019 and each transaction contains multiple attribute values of different data types. It causes difficulty to understand the evolution of Ethereum transactions related to Ether value transfer, smart contract creation and smart contract invocation, this thesis analyzes these activities with descriptive statistics, regression model and static plots for the entire time period. In addition, this thesis develops an application which allows users to select parties and time intervals for dynamic graph visualization of these activities. The significance of this thesis is to provide a macro-view on distribution and correlation for statistics, micro-view By developing an open-source program for large graph visualization and large graph layout, this paper enables easy access to evolution analysis of Ethereum transactions while reserves customizable functionalities for further development.  To understand major activities of Ethereum transactions including money transfer, contract creation and contract call, this paper conducts evolution analysis to gain new observations.
