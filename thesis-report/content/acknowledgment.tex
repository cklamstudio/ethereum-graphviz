First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr LUO Xiapu Daniel, for guiding me to complete this thesis under a difficult time. Daniel is knowledgeable and helpful in leading me to choose an interesting topic, then provides me valuable suggestions on learning the most from this research work.

Before starting this thesis, I had no idea about blockchain and I was not an experienced programmer. It was a huge challenge for me to decide a research topic of analyzing transactions on Ethereum blockchain. Daniel is patient enough to clear all my questions and make me comfortable and confident to take the challenge.

Finally, I would like to thank all my friends who have supported me in completing my thesis. With all of your help, I keep improving myself and solve problems more efficiently.
